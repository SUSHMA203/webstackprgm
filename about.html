    <p>"Go Travel strives to be known as the best travel marketing company in the world, not for its clients and who it serves, but for success it creates".<br><br>
We stand against the mistreatment of animals and the environment, and support an ethical tourism industry that enriches and uplifts communities – working with those that strive for the same goal".<br>
<br>
<p><strong>"Why"</strong><br>
 - Go Travel was born from a necessity to offer a better SEO and digital marketing service, and actually help businesses..<br><br>

Having been a travel SEO marketer and consultant for 10 years, Matt found there was no specific travel SEO service that explained exactly what they offered… and delivered. Fiverr, Freelancer and Upwork became tiresome to manage, with flakey freelancers and expensive mistakes. Fed up with paying other peoples’ “school fees”, Travel Tractions was created.<br><br>

You will never get sold something that we don’t know how to do. We believe in getting you a positive ROI on your marketing investment and will do everything in our power to do so, or we won’t take you on at all.<br><br>

Right now we believe we are one of the best SEO travel marketing agencies in the world, working to build a full-service marketing team in all aspects of the marketing process.<br><br>

We currently only offer SEO related services to the public but are working on website development, PPC, social media, and CRM, hoping to hire strategic individuals who are specialists in these areas strengthen our service offerings into a more holistic approach.<br></p>
